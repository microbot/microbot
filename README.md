## What is microbot?

Microbot is a developer framework, API and CLI for creating and running "bots". The goal of this project is to empower your applications and users with automated responses, actions and notifications throughout the developer lifecycle.

**What are bots, and what can they do?**

Bots are functions that only do one specific thing and do it well. This makes it easy to create more sophisticated workflows combining or chaining bots together. For example, a bot could:

- notify you when a new issue is opened on a GitHub repository
- send a follow up comment when a new GitHub issue is opened
- request more information when a new GitHub issue is opened
- validate that a pull request meets certain requirements
- count votes for "polls" in issues
- add labels to new repositories
- open an issue with a checklist of things to do on a new repository
- create default project files for new repositories
- notify maintainers when issues meet certain criteria
- send notifications to slack when new issues or pull requests are opened, or when a project or user is followed or starred

**Running bots**

Although bots can be used standalone, Microbot provides a system for creating and registering bots as "plugins", as well as coordinating the execution of them based on configuration, events, statuses, and so on.
