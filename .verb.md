## What is microbot?

Microbot is a developer framework for creating and running "bots". Bots can be thought of as microbot plugins that only do one specific thing and do it well.

**What can bots do?**

 - a bot could notify you when a new issue or pull request is created on a GitHub repository
 - a bot could send a follow up response when new issues or pull requests are created
 - a bot could send a notification to slack when a GitHub project is starred
